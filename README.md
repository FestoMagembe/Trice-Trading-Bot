## Strategy Overview

### Market Regime Detection

The system uses multiple methods to identify the current market condition:

- ATR-based volatility measurement
- Bollinger Band width analysis
- Moving average relationships
- ADX for trend strength detection
- Price structure analysis (higher highs/lower lows)

Based on this analysis, the EA categorizes the market into one of several regimes:
- TREND_UP
- TREND_DOWN
- RANGE
- VOLATILITY
- BREAKOUT_UP
- BREAKOUT_DOWN
- MIXED

### Strategy Selection

Each market regime uses a specialized strategy:

- **Trend Following**: Employs moving average crossovers, MACD, SuperTrend and Ichimoku confirmation
- **Range Trading**: Uses overbought/oversold conditions with Bollinger Bands and oscillators
- **Breakout Trading**: Identifies key levels and enters on volume-confirmed breakouts
- **Volatility Trading**: Adapts to high volatility with momentum entries and tighter stops

### Risk Management

The EA implements several risk models:

- **Fixed Risk**: Traditional percentage-based position sizing
- **Kelly Criterion**: Mathematical formula that optimizes position size based on edge
- **Adaptive Kelly**: Adjusts Kelly position sizing based on recent performance
- **Anti-Martingale**: Increases position size after wins, decreases after losses
